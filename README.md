# Barcode Reader Script
This script uses image processing techniques, specifically morphological operations, to isolate barcode lines, detect bounding boxes around the numbers, and extract each number from the barcode. The extracted barcode numbers are then saved to a text file.

## Features
- Detects barcode lines using morphological operations.
- Extracts numbers from the barcode and prints them to a .txt file.
